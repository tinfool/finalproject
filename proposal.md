# Color Picking Program

## Repository
<https://github.com/tinfool/finalproject.git>

## Description
I will code a color picker program that allows the user to click a point in an image and determine which RGB value the selected pixel is, as well as displaying the color and value. It will be useful to the industry because exact color values can be very useful in creating consistent textures from concept art references.

## Features
- Uploading Images
	- The user will be able to upload the URL of the image they want to find a color from.
- Color Picking
	- Based on the mouse's location, the program will get the information pixel it is hovering over.
- Display the Color
	- Based on the RGB value picked on the image, I will draw a square of that color and display the number underneath. 

## Challenges
- I must research how to let the user upload their own image to the project folder.
- I will look into creating my own UI to show both the image, as well as the color display.
- I need to refresh how to detect the pixels' values basesd on mouse position.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome would be a fullscreen UI showing the user's picture as well as having a section to the right displaying the (hopefully multiple) colors and it's RGB value.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The bare essentials for a functional outcome would probably be opening the image, clicking just once, and a new window opens with the UI of the color and RGB.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Have the user be able to put a URL of their image into the project.
  2. Display the image after getting it in the folder.

- Week 2
  1. Get the RBG of the pixel under the mouse click.
  2. Display a larger square of the color value with the numbers underneath.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Create a UI to display both windows at the same time.
  2. Be able to exit the program after the desired number of color picks.
